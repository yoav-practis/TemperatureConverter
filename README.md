# TemperatureConverter
Basic exercise to handle non-testable code.

Goals:
- Create a new Unit test project
- Add tests only for the Celcius class
- If you encounter non testable code - make it testable by using Dependency injection
- You can use any test double technique you want (such as stub, mock..)
- Don't fix the Logger class

Good luck!
